Fault handler
+++++++++++++

Fault handler for SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGBUS and SIGILL signals: display the
Python backtrace and restore the previous handler. Allocate an alternate stack
for this handler, if sigaltstack() is available, to be able to allocate memory
on the stack, even on stack overflow.

Import the module and call faulthandler.enable() to enable the fault handler.

The Python backtrace is written to the file descriptor 2 which is supposed to
be the standard error stream. Start your graphical applications in a terminal
and run your server in foreground to see the backtrace.

Example
=======

Example of a segmentation fault on Linux: ::

    $ python
    >>> import faulthandler
    >>> faulthandler.enable()
    >>> faulthandler.sigsegv()
    Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault

    Traceback (most recent call first):
      File "<stdin>", line 1 in <module>
    Segmentation fault


Installation
============

To install faulthandler module, type the following command: ::

    python setup.py install

Then you can test your setup using the following command: ::

    python tests.py

You need a C compiler (eg. gcc) and Python headers to build the faulthandler
module. Eg. on Fedora, you have to install python-devel package (sudo yum
install python-devel).


faulthandler module API
=======================

Fault handler state (disabled by default):

 * enable(): enable the fault handler
 * disable(): disable the fault handler
 * isenabled(): get the status of the fault handler

Dump the current backtrace:

 * dumpbacktrace(): dump backtrace of the current thread into stdout
 * dumpbacktrace_threads(): dump backtrace of all threads into stdout
 * dumpbacktrace_later(delay, repeat=False, all_threads=False): dump the
   backtrace of the current thread, or of all threads if all_threads is True,
   in delay seconds, or each delay seconds if repeat is True. It writes the
   backtrace(s) into the file descriptor 2 which is supposed to be stderr. If
   the function is called twice, the new call replaces previous parameters.
   Call cancel_dumpbacktrace_later() to call the next request.
 * cancel_dumpbacktrace_later(): cancel the previous call to
   dumpbacktrace_later()

dumpbacktrace_later() is implemented using the SIGALRM signal and the alarm()
function: if the signal handler is called during a system call, the system call
is interrupted (return EINTR).

Functions to test the fault handler:

 * sigbus(): raise a SIGBUS signal (Bus error)
 * sigfpe(): raise a SIGFPE signal (Floating point exception), do a division by
   zero
 * sigill(): raise a SIGILL signal (Illegal instruction)
 * sigsegv(): raise a SIGSEGV signal (Segmentation fault), read memory from
   NULL (address 0)

sigbus() and sigill() are not available on all operation systems.

The version can be read in the "version" attribute: use "version >> 8" to get
the major version, and "version & 255" to get the minor version.


Changelog
=========

Version 1.2 (under development)
-------------------------------

 * Add dumpbacktrace_later() and cancel_dumpbacktrace_later() function

Version 1.1 (2011-01-03)
------------------------

 * Disable the handler by default, because pkgutil may load the module and so
   enable the handler which is unexpected
 * Add dumpbacktrace() and dumpbacktrace_threads() functions
 * sigill() is available on Windows thanks to Martin's patch
 * Fix dump_ascii() for signed char type (eg. on FreeBSD)
 * Fix tests.py for Python 2.5

Version 1.0 (2010-12-24)
------------------------

 * First public release


Status
======

 * 2010-12-24: Tested with Python 2.6, 3.1 and 3.2 on Debian Sid
 * 2010-12-24: Tested with Python 2.6 and 3.1 on Windows XP

Application fault handlers:

 * The GNU libc has a fault handler in debug/segfault.c
 * XEmacs has a fault handler displaying the Lisp backtrace
 * RPy has a fault handler

System-wide fault handlers:

 * Ubuntu uses Apport: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport
 * The Linux kernel logs also segfaults into /var/log/kern.log (and
   /var/log/syslog). /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern contols how coredumps are
   created.
 * Windows opens a popup on a fatal error asking if the error should be
   reported to Microsoft
